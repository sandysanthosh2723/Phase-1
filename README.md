## Analysis Approach
To achieve our project objectives, we will follow these steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load air quality data from reliable sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. Handle missing values, outliers, and data quality issues.

3. **Data Analysis**: Utilize data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze air quality trends and identify pollution hotspots.

4. **Predictive Model**: Build a predictive model for RSPM/PM10 levels using regression or time series analysis.

5. **Visualization**: Choose effective visualization techniques (e.g., line charts, heatmaps) to represent air quality trends and pollution levels.

## Visualization Selection
We will select visualization techniques based on their effectiveness in conveying insights from our analysis:

- Line charts will be used to visualize air quality trends over time.

- Heatmaps will help us identify spatial variations in pollution levels, particularly pollution hotspots.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-quality-analysis.git
